              The Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) is an alternative education delivery mode, promulgated through Executive Order 330, which promotes access to continuing quality higher education. It is an effective system of academic equivalency and accreditation of prior learning from relevant work experiences and formal/non-formal educational training. Deputized Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) are authorized to conduct competency-based evaluation and award appropriate degrees to deserving individuals.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              The Commission on Higher Education deputized LCC Bacolod to offer ETEEAP for Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Liberal Arts in English Language Studies, and the Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management. The program follows a revised curriculum based on a 10-month timeframe with classes every Saturday.
